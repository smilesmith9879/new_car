AI Four-Wheel Drive Car Comprehensive Solution
March 3, 2025 – Second Edition
1. Functional Overview
This solution is based on the Raspberry Pi 5, combined with the official Raspberry Pi camera, a four-wheel-drive chassis, and PCA9685 servo control, to create an AI-powered car that supports web remote control, visual SLAM, autonomous navigation, and voice interaction.
✅ Web Control: Control the car’s movement using a simulated joystick on the web, adjust the camera gimbal angles, and view the camera feed in real time.
✅ Camera Gimbal Control: The servo supports up, down, left, and right rotation, controlled via a slider on the web interface.
✅ Real-time Video Streaming: Based on WebRTC for low-latency camera feed transmission.
✅ Remote API Control: Use Flask API + WebSocket for remote control of the car and camera.
✅ Map Modeling: Construct a visual SLAM map of the car’s environment using ORB-SLAM3.
✅ Map Partitioning & Naming: Users can manually name room areas on the web (e.g., "Living Room", "Bedroom").
✅ Path Planning & Autonomous Navigation: Plan the optimal path based on ORB-SLAM3 trajectories & A algorithm*.
✅ Voice Interaction: Utilize Whisper + Ollama + DeepSeekR1 1.7B for local voice recognition & interaction.
