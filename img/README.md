# Background Image Placeholder

The CSS references a background image file named `sheikah-bg.jpg` that needs to be placed in this directory.

For the best visual effect, please add a dark-themed background image that fits with the Sheikah/Tears of the Kingdom aesthetic. The image should be:

- Dark blue or black with subtle patterns
- High resolution (at least 1920x1080)
- Subtle enough not to distract from the UI elements

Suggested options:
1. A starry night sky with blue accents
2. Ancient Sheikah technology patterns with glowing blue lines
3. A dark abstract pattern with blue highlights

Once you have a suitable image, save it as `sheikah-bg.jpg` in this directory.
